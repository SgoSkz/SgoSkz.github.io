            <a href="#conf">Confucianism</a> and <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a>
            had many parallels in their origins and similar patterns when they
            were changed. Buddhism was considered to be more non-secular than
            Confucianism, later due to its non-secular ideas, Buddhism was
            considered to be a <a href="#def">Religion</a> rather than
            <a href="#def">Philosophy.</a> Of course, the fact that Buddhism
            and Confucianism had many parallels does not reflect their
            political choices and power.
