            <a href="#conf">Confucianism</a> and <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a>
            had many parallels in their origins and similar patterns when they
            were changed. Buddhism was considered to be more non-secular than
            Confucianism, later due to its non-secular ideas, Buddhism was
            considered to be a <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> rather than
            <a href="#R&P">Philosophy.</a> Of course, the fact that Buddhism
            and Confucianism had many parallels does not reflect their
            political choices and power.

            <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> and <a href="#R&P">Philosophy</a> are
            widely paralleled, the overlap between both
            <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> and <a href="#R&P">Philosophy</a> make
            it hard to define each one absolutely. During the time, Buddhism
            was considered by many to be Religious when it first came to
            Ancient China. Confucianism was considered to a
            <a href="#R&P">Philosophy</a>, of course, some people during the
            time disagreed and considered Confucius to be a religious figure.
            Putting an absolute definition of <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> or
            <a href="#R&P">Philosophy</a> on either Buddhism and/or
            Confucianism could be argued to be either 
            <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> or <a href="#R&P">Philosophy</a> due to
            the loose definitions of <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> and
            <a href="#R&P">Philosophy</a> and their many overlaps.
