            <a href="#conf">Confucianism</a> and <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a>
            had many parallels in their origins and similar patterns when they
            were changed. Buddhism was considered to be more non-secular than
            Confucianism, later due to its non-secular ideas, Buddhism was
            considered to be a <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> rather than
            <a href="#R&P">Philosophy.</a> Of course, the fact that Buddhism
            and Confucianism had many parallels does not reflect their
            political choices and power.

            <p>
            Religion and philosophy are widely paralleled, the overlap between
            both Religion and Philosophy make it hard to define each one
            absolutely. During the time, Buddhism was considered by many to be
            Religious when it first came to Ancient China. Confucianism was
            considered to a Philosophy, of course, some people during the time
            disagreed and considered Confucius to be a religious figure.
            Putting an absolute definition of Religion or Philosophy on either
            Buddhism and/or Confucianism could be argued to be either Religion
            or Philosophy due to the loose definitions of Religion and
            Philosophy and their many overlaps.
