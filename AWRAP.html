            The Buddhist and Confucianist
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Basics
        </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        Religion and philosophy have many overlapping characteristics,
        but differ in the fact that religion is strongly about belief and faith
        in a higher power whereas philosophy is more centered around theorizing
        other worldly matters through knowledge. The comparison of Buddhism and
        Confucianism exemplifies the similarities and differences of a concept
        similar to religion and philosophy, specifically secularity. Buddhism,
        similarly to Confucianism began as a philosophy, but by contrast, was
        less worldly than Confucianism. Political ruling styles can be
        influenced by a person’s approach to secularity. More grounded thoughts
        like those from Confucianism were preferred because they could be
        applied to worldly issues better than those from Buddhism due to the
        fact that it dealt with non-secular concepts. The political ruling of
        Confucianism in China was more popular than that of Buddhism as a
        result of its more secular practices despite the many similarities
        between Confucianism and Buddhism.

        <h2>
            Beginning of Buddhism
        </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        The origins of Buddhism began from one person named Siddhartha Gautama.
        Many Buddhist often refer to him as Buddha.  Buddhism began more
        focused on the importance of a philosophical aspect rather than a
        religious aspect because its focus was rather, not on deity or
        spirituality, in this sense, Buddhism began in a more secular fashion
        than religions. Siddhartha Gautama was credited to have brought up
        messages of compassion, morality, and equality.  Although Buddhism had
        originated from Hinduism, Siddhartha Gautama, having provided equality
        among the people in the society, removed the caste system from
        Buddhism.  In Buddhism, it was universally accepted that Siddhartha was
        the enlightened one.  Although, Buddhism came off of the many concepts
        of Hinduism, it was not a religion like Hinduism was, it still applied
        mostly to the material world and did not have worship of a deity.  Of
        course, with parallels to Hinduism, Buddhism would also have some
        practices and concepts that are non-secular.

            Buddhism's Main Concepts
        </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        Although Buddhism had many different schools with variations of what
        Buddha had said, each school of Buddhism had one main focus which was
        to reach a state called Nirvana.  A state past that of the cyclic
        process of birth and death; the final cessation of the suffering that
        characterizes the ordinary world.  Many Buddhist, in order to find the
        path to Nirvana, followed the teachings of Buddha. These teachings
        included “the Noble Eightfold Path” and “the Four Noble Truths,” which
        not only addressed Buddhist, but also every sentient being.  “The Four
        Noble Truths,” in short, explained that people endured constant
        suffering because of desires, so in order to rid oneself of suffering,
        one would have to cease any desires.  The concept of Nirvana was deeply
        ingrained within Buddhism and was practiced and refined. Despite being
        practiced and refined, Buddhism split into different schools which had
        interpreted Buddha’s saying differently.  Although Buddhism’s branching
        ideas changed in the many years after its establishment, including when
        it had entered China, the core concepts of Buddhism had remained the
        same.

        <h2>
            Buddhism Moves to China
        </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        When Buddhism had entered China, it was widely acknowledged during the
        time as a religion that borrowed from Daoism in order to enter China.
        Daoist “and like-minded intellectuals began to work with Buddhist monks
        to translate the sutras which the monks had brought with them.”
        Naturally, with translations, there followed changes in the sutras,
        mainly the fact “that the monks made some effort to express the texts
        in Daoistic language that would appeal to the Chinese, and that the
        Chinese interpreted the texts as a sort of Daoist exotica.”  The
        mistranslations of the text created the misconception that Buddha was
        actually Laozi, along with the misconception of Buddha, came the
        misinterpretation of Buddhist scripture being the Dao De Jing.  As the
        numbers of monks and established Buddhist monasteries increased, more
        sophisticated translations of Buddhist text were produced and more
        Chinese followers came to a better understanding of the nature of
        Buddhism.  Given the better translations of the sutras, more Chinese
        youths seceded from their society and became Buddhist monks. Along with
        the growing communities of Buddhism came monastic communities, though,
        the communities were of seclusion and contemplation rather than for
        religious purposes ultimately showing the more philosophical side of
        Buddhism.

        <h2>
            Beginning of Confucianism
        </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        Confucianism similarly to Buddhism began without religion in mind, it
        was only teachings. Confucianism did not go beyond the material world;
        it did not have ideas like Nirvana and originated in China.  Unlike
        religions, “[…] Confucianism ‘has no priesthood, no church, no bible,
        no creed, no conversion, and no fixed system of gods. It has no
        interest in either theology or mythology.”  Although Confucianism did
        differ from Buddhism in aspect of having more material concepts,
        Confucianism was similar to Buddhism in respect to their origins.
        Similar to Buddhism, Confucianism began with a single person named
        Confucius, who was accredited to be one of the largest influencers of
        China.  Confucius, unlike Buddha, was seen as a sage or teacher by his
        followers, not someone who was perceived as divine or a savior.  Though
        there existed concepts that may have been similar between Confucianism
        and Buddhism, Confucianism did not originate after Buddhism and thereby
        did not have the non-secular ideas of Buddhism and is, in this aspect,
        perceived as secular philosophy rather than non-secular philosophy like
        Buddhism.

        <h2>
            Confucianism’s Main Concepts
        </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        Confucianism was a philosophy based off secular awareness and
        understanding as it never gave its opinion on equality or birth, but
        instead, it focused on education.  Students of Confucius varied from
        rich to poor because of the unstable social order during his time. The
        social standings of his students did not affect his teachings as he
        emphasized “that any person could become a junzi, ‘noble, unselfish,
        kind, just’, irrespective of birth.”   The teachings of Confucianism
        did not only apply to life, but also government. In the Confucianist
        belief, human life and politics strived if in accordance of “Do not do
        to others what you would not want others to do to you.”  Confucianism
        further split because of two disciples of Confucius, Mengzi and Xunzi.
        Xunzi was stricter and followed a more authoritarian method than
        Mengzi. Mengzi believed every human was innately good, but had to
        recapture that goodness from greed and stressed kindness in the
        government.  On the other hand, Xunzi believed that men were innately
        evil and must study goodness to achieve it. Despite the split of
        methods in Confucianism, neither of the two argued against everyone
        being able to become junzi.

        <h2>
            Similarities of Buddhism and Confucianism
        </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        Although Buddhism and Confucianism had differed in many ways, there
        were also many parallels within the two. Some parallels include: their
        origin, separate schools, and consistent core concepts between each
        separate school. Regardless of the many parallels in the secularity of
        Buddhism and Confucianism, their political tact was completely
        different because of one of Buddhism’s more non-secular ideas, mainly
        rebirth and concepts which connected to it.  Buddhism was ultimately
        less active in terms of government, one reason was “that there was less
        need for political philosophy in a world where the belief in cosmic
        justice was predominant,”  cosmic justice referring to the means at
        which humans were rebirthed. Buddhism’s form of “cosmic justice” was
        determined by chance and by one’s karma. By contrast, Confucianism did
        not rely on such methods to determine a righteous person, but instead
        it based government and politics by moral.  In addition, Confucianism
        was in favor because it created national schools in order to train
        civil officials in Confucian principles and text.  An advocate of
        Confucian training, Dong Zhongshu, made Confucian state [of being]
        orthodox, replacing prior Legalist state.  He endorsed limitations of
        land and servants in order to prevent imbalanced growth of wealth.
        “Great families still continued to have much social, political, and
        economic power” because Zhongshu only avoided further imbalanced growth
        of wealth, ultimately gaining the favor of both powerful and poor
        families.

        <h2>
            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
        Confucianism and Buddhism may have had similar origins, for example,
        both starting from the teachings of a single person, but Buddhism’s
        concepts were more non-secular than that of Confucianism. Because of
        these non-secular ideas, Buddhism’s concepts could not be applied to
        the political system as well as Confucianism’s. It was unconventional
        to run the political system through means that seemed irrational thus
        Confucianism greatly impacted the Chinese political system due to
        Confucianism becoming orthodox and moral based concepts unlike the
        “cosmic justice” provided by Buddhism. No other philosophy was as
        deeply influential as that of Confucianism, it was ultimately a
        “moulder of the Chinese mind and character.”
